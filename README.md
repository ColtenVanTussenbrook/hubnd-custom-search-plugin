# HUBND custom search plugin

WordPress plugin that will take a search term generated from a custom post type (also included in the plugin) and then output search results as links with the search query term in the link.

Makes it easy to provide external links that can be generated from a users's search term.

Specific to HUBND but could easily be extended to work across other sites.
